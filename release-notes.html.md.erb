<% current_page.data.title = vars.windows_runtime_full + " " + vars.v_major_version + " Release Notes" %>

This topic contains release notes for <%= vars.windows_runtime_full %> (<%= vars.windows_runtime_abbr %>) <%= vars.v_major_version %>.

Because VMware uses the Percona Distribution for MySQL, expect a time lag between Oracle releasing a MySQL patch and VMware releasing
<%= vars.windows_runtime_abbr %> containing that patch.

Before you install the tile, review the [Windows Stemcell Compatibility Matrix](stemcells.html#compatibility).

## <a id='upgrade'></a> How to Upgrade

The <%= vars.windows_runtime_abbr %> <%= vars.v_major_version %> tile is available with the release of <%= vars.app_runtime_full %>
(<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>) <%= vars.v_major_version %>. To use the <%= vars.windows_runtime_abbr %> <%= vars.v_major_version %> tile, you must install
<%= vars.ops_manager_full %> <%= vars.v_major_version %> or later and <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> <%= vars.v_major_version %> or later.


## <a id='new-features'></a> New Features in <%= vars.windows_runtime_abbr %> <%= vars.v_major_version %>

<%= vars.windows_runtime_abbr %> <%= vars.v_major_version %> includes the following major feature:

### <a id='windows-syslog'></a> <%= vars.windows_runtime_abbr %> Uses windows-syslog for Syslog Forwarding

<%= vars.windows_runtime_abbr %> <%= vars.v_major_version %> uses `windows-syslog` to forward logs from BOSH jobs on <%= vars.windows_runtime_abbr %> VMs to
the syslog endpoint you configure.

`windows-syslog` also allows you to configure <%= vars.windows_runtime_abbr %> VMs to connect to the syslog endpoint over TLS.

If you are upgrading to <%= vars.windows_runtime_abbr %> <%= vars.v_major_version %> from <%= vars.windows_runtime_abbr %> v2.13, and you manually added
`windows-syslog` as a BOSH add-on to the runtime configuration for your <%= vars.windows_runtime_abbr %> v2.13 deployment, you must remove the add-on before
you upgrade.

For more information, see the [windows-syslog-release](https://www.github.com/cloudfoundry/windows-syslog-release) on GitHub.


## <a id='breaking-changes'></a> Breaking Changes

<%= vars.windows_runtime_abbr %> <%= vars.v_major_version %> includes the following breaking change:

### <a id='global-log-rate-limit'></a> Global Log Rate Limit is Deprecated

The global log rate limit that measures app log rates in lines per second is deprecated in favor of per-app log rate limits that measure app log rates in
bytes per second.

If you have configured a global log rate limit in lines per second, <%= vars.recommended_by %> recommends that you re-configure your apps to use log rate
limits in bytes per second.

If you still want to use the global log rate limit, logs that exceed the log rate limit are immediately dropped. Previously, logs that exceeded the log rate
limit were buffered and released at the configured log rate.

For more information about app log rate limits, see [App Log Rate Limiting](../loggregator/app-log-rate-limits.html).

### <a id='syslog-format'></a> windows-syslog Uses a Different Log Format

The logs that `windows-syslog` forwards to the configured syslog endpoint for your <%= vars.windows_runtime_abbr %> deployment follow a different format from
that of previous logs.

If your observability platform is configured to gather data by parsing forwarded system logs, you may need to re-configure your rules to accommodate the
following format changes:

* The priority is changed from `kernel/debug(7)` to `user/info(14)`.

* The app name is changed from `Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing` to `event_logger`.

* The process number is changed from a numerical process ID to `rs2`.

* Logs contain structured data for instance and deployment details.

* The event log JSON string includes additional fields.

* In the event log JSON string, field names are written in camel case.

* In the event log JSON string, fields may appear in a different order.

The following example shows the previous log format:
